# (What) should I prefix?

**NOTE:** Any help is much appreciated. At the moment this is a very simple MVP-style one pager and some of the info is missing. Ideas and feedback? @valuedstandards !

Knowing what CSS features to prefix is hard. Things change (-OperaKit- anyone?) and documentation, even Preprocessor mixin libraries, are often out of date.
This is simply(!) an attempt to have a handy list of CSS features and their prefixes, if any.

It is a WIP, not complete, will contain errors blah blah
